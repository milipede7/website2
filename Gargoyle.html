    <h1>Chicago Gargoyle App</h1>

In this iOS app, the user can generate their own Chicago gargoyle by tapping on the different body parts of the creature. These parts are drawn randomly from a large database of images of actual gargoyles, taken from historic buildings from around the city. The app also has a light sensor which affects its aesthetics-- when there is a bright light present, the app responds by changing the background color to white and selecting only from gloomier physical traits for the gargoyles. When the app senses lower light, the background turns black and the characteristics of the creatures are in turn friendlier. The image bank was compiled in Adobe Illustrator and the app itself was designed and coded in X-code with Objective-C. Below are screenshots from the app being used on an iPhone.
