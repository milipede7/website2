    <h1>Voices From the Margins</h1>
<p>
  In collaboration with the members of Red Line Service,
  this multimedia piece was designed as an appeal to the humanity
  of people experiencing homelessness to the UN. It was essentially a book
  of articles and poetry with a running theme of personal stories which related
  to famous artworks, and to supplement the book, my collaborators and I worked with the authors
  to create a video that might capture the same spirit, as well as help to catch people's eye.
  In the video, each member of the group read the last couple seentences of their piece,
  and then the voices all came together in a chatter to represent the unity in their struggle.
  In tandem with several other groups, the piece was shown in a gallery space where members of the
  UN absorbed the content. We hope that our work might inspire them to address homelessness
  as one of their global priorities.
