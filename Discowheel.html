Collabration with Andreas Pils at <a href="https://schmiedehallein.com/" target="_blank">Schmiede</a>

Kinetic light-emitting sculpture composed from found objects. Mechanical parts: a bike wheel,
back rack, fender, inner tubes. Electronic parts: a motor and motor driver from a coffee machine, power supply
and LED strip from an LCD TV. Optical parts: polarizing film from an LCD TV, lenses from a camera, red bull cans.
There is a switch to turn the lamp on, another to turn the motor on and reverse the direction, and a knob to control the motor speed.

Turntable: Sound sculpture based on a turntable with a generative angular placement. The vinyl, a recording of Carillion Bells,
becomes unrecognizable due to the altered angle of the turntable, which leads the needle to gently bounce on the surface and randomly loop
the record. The loops are only modified by slight disturbances in the air of the surrounding space.
